<h1>Welcome to the Sorting Hat!</h1>
<p>
    This program efficiently assigns first-year Lewis & Clark students to their first-year seminar courses based on
    their class preferences. This program also ensures that classes gender balances are within a reasonable threshold of
    the overall student population in addition to ensuring that each class does not have too many athletes.</p>
